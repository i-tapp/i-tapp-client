// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SWITCHBOARD
//
// One place that decides which "feels like an app" features are on in which
// runtime. Flip a value here and the whole app follows - no hunting through
// components. See src/lib/app-mode.ts for how the mode itself is detected.
//
//   app     - native Capacitor shell AND installed PWA
//   browser - normal browser tab (the public website)
//   all     - everywhere
//   native  - the compiled store build only, never the installed PWA
//   off     - disabled everywhere

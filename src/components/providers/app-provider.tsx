// AppModeProvider must be the outermost wrapper - everything below it asks
// it whether we're running as the installed app or as the public website.
// What each piece does in each mode lives in src/config/app-features.ts;
// none of these components decide for themselves.
//
// ThemeProvider sits directly inside AppModeProvider: dark mode is app-only,
// so it needs the mode, and everything rendered below it should be able to
// read the resolved theme.
//
// QueryCachePersistence has to sit above PullToRefresh: both use the React
// Query client, and the cache must be restored before anything can refetch
// against it.
//
// The tree shape is identical in both modes on purpose. The app-only bits
// switch themselves off internally rather than being conditionally mounted,
// so `children` is never unmounted and remounted when the mode resolves.
//
// DeepLinkHandler and GetTheAppBanner are opposite ends of the same split -
// one is native-only, the other browser-only - and both are siblings rather
// than wrappers, so each can safely return null in the mode it isn't for.
